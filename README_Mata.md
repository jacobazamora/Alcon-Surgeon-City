I am conintuing to work on the UI. I will push to github before our checkup on Tuesday

I Have been working on getting used to react with the tutorials and stuff that was suggested to us.
I will begin to make the Ui for the following week

I attempted to add the submodule of where I worked on the heroku web app. however
when I attempted to go into the directory, it gave a 404 not found error. I am going to
leave it there for now as a place placeholder, while I get our own web app running.
The link to the original code from Heroku can be found at the following link:
https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git
I spent several hours going through the tutorial and attempting to modify the code,
but was not able to get it to show in this repository. The fact that the code is not
part of the project is not important, since I am going to replace that code. When i get our web app running, I will just delete that directory since it does not have anything,
along with the .gitmodules directory.

This week we worked to redefine our project idea. One of the things that we decided that we were going to need a web app for our project is that. I have previously worked on a web app, however I only worked on the backend of the project.

For this project I am going to be tasked with working on the front end of the web app. I don't have a lot of experience with working on front end programming, including the languages.

I have began to do some research on how making a web app works and will put in the time to do the work

I have also recently started doing an online course on Udemy for web development This will be a good opportunity to learn and get better at new skills and apply some of the things that I learned through the online course.

Much of the work that we did this week was on continuing the research we did on machine learning. And again it went into looking into our project and improving it, so that is more clearly defined. We met with our mentors to work on a new idea for the project, and got some good input form them.

This week I also looked into last years PRDs to get a better idea of what is expected from the document. I got a better understanding of what we need to do and the main ideas. All the documents had an intro, a high level diagram of the project idea, a list of the user stories, and a lost of the technologies that were going to be used.

This is some of the code that we can use towards the web app on the front end
We can use bootstrap
I will continue to work on the frontend to have a basic web app running by the
end of sprint 2. The code turns the headers into how they will be displayed rather
than text.

// I found that we could use the openCV library in python to handle the image
// and video processing.
// This code takes in a video as inout and shows it to you frame by frame
// We can manipulate this and work on each frame at a time and check if each
// frame contains a key image that we want to identify such as a tool used
// in surgery.
// To do this identifying we need to use machine learning to train a program to
//  identify the images and flag them so that we can save them for the
// highlight of the surgery.

// I also looked into how to implement machine learning. There are many
// libraries and established networks whose code we can use as reference, but
//  the greater challenge that we faced that I noticed from the research that
// I did was that we need a good set of training data to put into our machine
// learning algorithm, which we don't have. This is going to be a one of our
// greater challenges since we do not have a bunch of images of eye surgery
// tools to use to train the data.

// The following is some example code of how we can train a program ourselves
// once we have a good training data set
